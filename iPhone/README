This project is based on http://codingnaked.wordpress.com/tag/iphone-macosx-xcode-scheme-build-phase-objective-c-c/ / http://github.com/weiju/xcode-gambitc-templates/tree/master .

I have updated it to work on 3.1 and have included the compiled simulator and device libs in Gambit-C.zip . Gambit-C.zip should be moved to /usr/local/ . Also if you plan to use the simulator you will need to change your linking search path to not include the device folder otherwise it gets confused and won't link.

The gamb-c libs were built on 10.5 my guess is that the device libs should work on 10.6 but the simulator may not.

Hopefully I can get some neat little demo things in this project.
